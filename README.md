In this assignment, you will adopt the persona of being a data scientist for Allegheny County’s Health Department.  Your goal is to build data science tools to make it easier for the health department to understand trends of an ongoing health crisis:  fatal accidental overdoses from a variety of drugs in the county.  The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center publishes a monthly dataset that describes fatal accidental overdose incidents in Allegheny County, denoting age, gender, race, drugs present, zip code of incident and zip code of residence.

This data, downloaded as of September 22, 2023, is located in [data/overdose_data_092223.csv](data/overdose_data_092223.csv)

Through a series of assignments, you will build out a dashboard to support the interactive exploration and analysis of the dataset.  You will use this same repository for Assignments 3a, 3b, and 3c.
