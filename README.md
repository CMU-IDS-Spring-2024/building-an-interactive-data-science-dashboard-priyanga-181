In this assignment, you will adopt the persona of being a data scientist for Allegheny County‚Äôs Health Department.  Your goal is to build data science tools to make it easier for the health department to understand trends of an ongoing health crisis:  fatal accidental overdoses from a variety of drugs in the county.  The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center publishes a monthly dataset that describes fatal accidental overdose incidents in Allegheny County, denoting age, gender, race, drugs present, zip code of incident and zip code of residence.

This data, downloaded as of September 22, 2023, is located in [data/overdose_data_092223.csv](data/overdose_data_092223.csv)

Through a series of assignments, you will build out a dashboard to support the interactive exploration and analysis of the dataset.  You will use this same repository for Assignments 3a, 3b, and 3c.  

- [ ] For Assignment 3a, Update the provided Streamlit python file, `pages/1_üë•_Demographics.py`
- [ ] For Assignment 3b, Update the provided Streamlit python file, `pages/2_üìà_Trends.py`
- [ ] For Assignment 3c, Update the provided Streamlit python file, `pages/3_üåç_Map.py`
- [ ] In addition, submit your Github repository URL on Canvas for each of the three assignments.

## Running the Streamlit app

You can execute the Streamlit app by running `streamlit run County_Dashboard.py`


1. Did you notice any interesting patterns or trends in the dataset?
   The dataset reveals a notable trend of increasing fatal overdoses over time, peaking around 2016-2017, suggesting a potential epidemic phase or a shift in reporting practices. Middle-aged individuals seem disproportionately affected, as evidenced by the age distribution skewing towards this demographic. Furthermore, there is a pronounced racial discrepancy, with the White population experiencing a higher number of overdoses compared to other racial groups, which may reflect demographic differences or reporting variances within the studied region.

2. Was it possible to understand how the dataset was different in the earlier years versus the more recent years?
   The current dashboard design with a year range slider and a drug type dropdown allows for basic temporal and categorical filtering but does not readily facilitate a clear understanding of how the dataset differs between earlier and more recent years. To make these differences more accessible, incorporating interactive elements such as a comparative analytics feature would be beneficial. This feature could include side-by-side visual comparisons, trend lines indicating changes in demographics or drug prevalence over time.
   
3.Did you discover any filters that demonstrated big differences from the overall dataset among the demographics (such as age, race, or gender)?
It's intriguing to observe the demographic patterns that emerge from the data. The age distribution visualization suggests a specific age range where fatal overdoses are most prevalent, likely pointing to a demographic with higher susceptibility or exposure to overdose risks. The gender data clearly shows a higher incidence in males, which could reflect behavioral, biological, or societal differences in substance use or access to care. The racial distribution highlights a disproportionate impact on the White population, prompting questions about underlying social determinants of health or disparities in substance use patterns.

4. Are there any other features you wish were present in your dashboard to either make discovery easier or to explore alternative aspects of the dataset?
I'd appreciate additional features to deepen my analysis. Interactive trend lines showing changes over time within selected demographic filters would make temporal trends more discernible. A feature to compare data points across different demographics side by side would be insightful, especially to explore correlations or causations. Breakdowns of overdoses by socioeconomic status, geographical location, and education level would add layers of context to the demographic data.
